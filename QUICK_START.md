# 🚀 Quick Start: Daily Writing

## Create Your First Daily Post

```powershell
# From the project root
.\scripts\new-post.ps1
```

That's it! The script will:
1. Create a new post file with today's date
2. Fill it with a helpful template
3. Open it for you to start writing

## With a Custom Title

```powershell
.\scripts\new-post.ps1 "Learning React Hooks"
```

## Daily Writing Tips

✅ **Start small** - Even one sentence counts  
✅ **Be consistent** - Write at the same time each day  
✅ **Don't overthink** - Just write something  
✅ **Use the template** - It has helpful prompts  

## Template Sections

- **What I Learned Today** - Capture new knowledge
- **What I'm Working On** - Current projects
- **Thoughts & Reflections** - Process your day
- **Tomorrow's Focus** - Plan ahead
